# GUIFinal
Here I made iTunes for android.  The Apple search api is open to the public, so I took the endpoints and built a basic version of iTunes.
The app was made for a school assignment, but has the same base that I use for most app production.  This project has not been polished because of the short time span.
Libraries used:
  Dagger
  Retrofit
  Parceler
  Butterknife
  Picasso
  ActiveAndroid
