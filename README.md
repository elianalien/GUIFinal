# GUIFinal
Here I made iTunes for android.  The Apple search api is open to the public, so I took the endpoints and built a basic version of iTunes.
The app was made for a school assignment, but has the same base that I use for most app production.  This project has not been polished because of the short time span.
Libraries used:
  Dagger
  Retrofit
  Parceler
  Butterknife
  Picasso
  ActiveAndroid

## iTunes for Android

As an assignment for my Graphical User Interface class, I was tasked with Creating iTunes on Android.  Apple provides their Search API free of charge, so we capitalized on that.  I used all of the latest API's and Android Marshmallow.  I had a collaborator who worked with me on the assignment, Erik Gabrielsen.  Below are some screenshots of the app behavior.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
