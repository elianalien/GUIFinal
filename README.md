## iTunes for Android

As an assignment for my Graphical User Interface class, I was tasked with Creating iTunes on Android.  Apple provides their Search API free of charge, so we capitalized on that.  I used all of the latest API's and Android Marshmallow.  I had a collaborator who worked with me on the assignment, Erik Gabrielsen.  Below are some screenshots of the app behavior.

## Functionality

- Search for music by Artist, Album, Song, and so much more
- View your last 5 searches for quick searching things you love
- View the results with their appealing art
- Quickly know if the song is explicit by the red title
- Play the 30 second music sample to make sure it is right
- Click the star in the top right corner to favorite a song
- Click the title for more information like artist, album, and price
